### Introduction

The **Restaurant Rating** dataset provides information on restaurants in Mexico based on a 2012 customer survey. The survey collected data on restaurant types, cuisines, consumer demographics, and preferences. This analysis aims to extract meaningful insights to guide business entrepreneurs and investors in making informed decisions.



## Problem Statement

1.	What can we learn from the highest-rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences affect ratings?

2.	What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate bias in the data sample?

3.	Are there demand and supply gaps that can be exploited in the market?

4.	If investing in a restaurant, which characteristics would be most important?
